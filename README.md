# Breast Cancer Predictor

The Breast Cancer Diagnosis app is a machine learning-based tool designed to support medical professionals in diagnosing breast cancer. By analyzing specific measurements,
the app predicts whether a breast mass is benign or malignant. It features a radar chart to visually represent the input data and displays the predicted diagnosis along 
with the probability of the mass being benign or malignant. Users manually enter the measurements into lab machine to retrieve data directly. However, the lab 
connection feature is external to the app.

This app was created as a machine learning exercise using the publicly available Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. Please note that this dataset
may not be entirely reliable, as the project was developed for educational purposes in machine learning and is not intended for professional medical use.
